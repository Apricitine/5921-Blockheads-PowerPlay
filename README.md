# Hi!!!
Welcome to 5921's team code for POWERPLAY! If you're a team member with code you'd like to push, make a pull request and submit it for review, and we'll look at it during a meeting sometime. If you want to start working on the code, you can use *Github Codespaces* or just clone it to your local machine like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/Apricitine/5921-Blockheads-PowerPlay
```
Then you can open it up from Android Studio and start making changes!
