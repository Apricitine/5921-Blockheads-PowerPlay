# Hello
This is the code for the 5921's (La Canada Engineering Club) FTC robot. Luke does roadrunner and very good stuff that Leo doesn't understand, and Leo does all the useful (but simpler) stuff frequently and comes with ideas that are beneficial to the team, but he uses Vim instead of Emacs, as one should NOT. 
 
If for some reason you want to see Luke's website, you find it in all of its malmagnificence [here](https://blockheads-5921.vercel.app).
