Hello and welcome to team 5921, or the La Canada Engineering Club's repository for the 2022-2023 FTC season powerplay!
If the current season is still Powerplay, please talk to Luke or Leo because we need more programmers. If it's a future season,
also talk to Luke or Leo if you have any questions about anything.
Some questions that I had when starting out, with answers:

Q: Where are the actual programs that get run?
A: Teamcode/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

Q: What's an opmode?
A: Basically, a program for the robot to run.

Q: Where is the actual code that gets run, or the "main" method?
A: It doesn't really matter, just put your stuff in a file in teamcode.

Q: Where are the motors and things defined?
A: For this codebase, Teamcode/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/common/HardwareDrive.java

Q: What do I need to add to Android Studio to program for FTC?
