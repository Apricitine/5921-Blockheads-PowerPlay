# Hello
This is the code for the 5921's (La Canada Engineering Club) FTC robot. Luke does dumb stuff with it occasionally that are usually not beneficial and spends all of his time working on the website which nobody will see. Leo does all the useful stuff frequently and comes with ideas that are beneficial, but he uses Vim instead of Emacs.
