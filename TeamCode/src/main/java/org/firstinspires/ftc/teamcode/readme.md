### Directories
***
#### driveModes -
> This directory contains all of our opmodes for teleop. There are quite a few; each is continously iterated upon and used. *BaseDrive03_TwoDrivers.java* is the one that finds the most use and the one that we plan to commit to the most.
#### common -
> This directory contains constants and common assets we use everywhere throughout our code. Our base drive opmode, enums and other constants, pids, utilty classes and cv are in this folder. As of this commit, we do not have a working pid controller but plan to create classes for those in the future.
#### auto -
> This directory contains opmodes for the autonomous portion of the competition. We currently have multiple files we are using to practice auto but the files beginning with PowerPlay are the ones we use the most.
#### concepts -
> This folder has classes we've moved from the defaults folder in the Robot Controller. These classes are simply ones that are of interest to us or ones that might be of use later on.
